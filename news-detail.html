                <p>For 2025, we made changes to Ascension where teams who earned promotion can defend or extend their stay in the VCT based on performance. Ascension winners will be judged on their performance across the entire year of the International League, falling into one of the three categories.</p>

                <p>As the year comes to a close, we want to share some initial details about the 2025 Challengers Season. Next season we want to continue deepening the connection between Challengers and all parts of the VCT ecosystem. Challenger Leagues are an essential tier of competition where up-and-coming players can hone their skills and build the recognition of their talents. Similar to 2024, Challengers will span the entire year with competition kicking off in January, culminating in Ascension in October, and concluding in December with Challengers and Premier tournaments.</p>
                <p>To better align the Challengers calendar with the year round format, we are introducing another stage of regular season competition prior to Ascension. This will increase the quantity of competition, further reduce the amount of downtime during the year, and provide additional opportunities for promotion. We saw a great amount of success with the increased promotion opportunities in 2024 with teams like Sin Prisa and PACIFIC Esports rising to the top of Challengers in a short period of time after their Premier runs. We will keep the two promotion qualifiers during the regular season to give teams the chance to go from Premier into the VCT within the context of a single year. Keep an eye out for additional information about your region's Challenger League as formats and promotion timings may vary depending on the Challenger League.</p>
                <p>Due to the changes, Ascension formats are going to be adjusted to account for multiple scenarios, such as both Ascension teams relegating and needing to bring two new CL teams to the event. We are giving regional leagues more flexibility to create unique formats that best fit their respective needs, while making sure they continue to connect to Premier and Ascension. Leagues will be announcing their competition formats and information on their Ascension tournaments later on in 2025.</p>
                <p>In 2025 this path will remain in place and every Act will allow top Premier teams to earn promotion into Challengers. However, due to Challenger Seasons being twice as long as each Premier Season, teams from Premier will be brought up into Challengers every two Acts. If a team wins an Act that does not immediately coincide with the start of a Challengers League, they will be promoted during the following Act. This means that if you win Episode 9 Act 3 of Premier you may have to wait until the conclusion of Episode 10 Act 1 for your opportunity to play into Challengers. Rest easy though, no matter when you jump into Premier you will have a path to Challengers.</p>
